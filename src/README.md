#Google Drive Workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)
This workflow searched your google drive and opens the files in your browser. They keyword is "d" (example ```d alfred```).

With ```enter``` you can open the entry in your default browser.

You have to login (```d > login```) before you can use the workflow. The login uses OAuth, so you do not need to enter your credentials.
